# Bootstrap-Portfolio
assignment 2 pt 1

/ did as much as i could with formatting it like the page in the "Solutions" folder

/ still not sure what bootstrap is doing to the .html exactly, but it's linked regardless

/ i will go back and fix a few things when things settle down. For now, I need to get back on track in the course as quickly as possible
